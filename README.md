### Udacity Bikeshare Analysis
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Description
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day
#### 2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#### 3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time
#### 4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
All four of these files are zipped up in the "all_project_files" document in the Resources tab in the sidebar on the left side of this page. (You may need to scroll down inside the Resources tab to see the "all_project_files" doc.) You can choose to download and unzip that "all_project_files" doc to access all four project files, and do your project work on your local machine.
If you'd prefer, the later Project Workspace page in the classroom here also has the bikeshare.py file and all the city dataset files included in it, and you can do all your work on the project with them there. If you choose this option, you don't need to download the files from the Resources tab.

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
    - Gender
    - Birth Year
